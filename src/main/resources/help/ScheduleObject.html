<P>A schedule is a transaction which is executed at fixed intervals. 
Each time MyMoney starts, it will check for scheduled transactions. 
If the schedule date has been reached, the transaction will be
recorded and then the schedule date will be set to the next interval.
 A schedule is useful for any transaction which occurs at fixed
intervals for a fixed amount.</P>

<P>Transaction splits are used when a schedule transaction has
multiple components.  For example, a salary payment may contain
federal and state withholding with the balance being deposited in a
checking account.  Or a loan payment would consist of interest and
principal payments.  In these cases, you would create a transaction
split with a split transaction for each component of the schedule
transaction.</P>
