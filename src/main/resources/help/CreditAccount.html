<P>A credit account represents charges and payments for a credit card
or line of credit. A bank account is used for debit card charges
since the money is deducted directly from a checking account.
Transactions in a credit account can be reconciled with statements
received from the bank.</P>
<P>A transaction can be assigned a category (such as Cable, Dividend,
Interest, Utilities, etc). The category is used when generating a
transaction report and when estimating taxes. You do not need to
assign a category to a transaction (the default is no category when
you create a transaction).</P>
<P>Instead of a category, a transaction can be assigned a transfer
account. Transfer accounts appear in the Category/Account field with
the name enclosed in &ldquo;[]&rdquo;. This causes money used to make
a payment to be withdrawn from the transfer account. You create just
a single transaction which affects two accounts (you do not create a
separate transaction in the bank account to represent the payment).
You can create the payment transaction in either the bank account or
the credit account, specifying the other account as the transfer
account.</P>
<P>The memo is an optional field which is used to describe the
transaction.</P>
<P>You must specify a charge or payment amount.</P>
<P>You should leave the Not Reconciled button selected when you
create a transaction. Refer to the Reconciling Transactions section
for more information.</P>

<P>When you reconcile transactions, you indicate which transactions
appear on your bank statement. This is done by pressing the Reconcile
Transactions button and then entering the ending balance from the
statement (this will normally be a negative value indicating you owe
money). A dialog will be displayed listing all of the unreconciled
transactions for the account. Each time you click on a transaction, a
'c' is added or removed for the transaction. The 'c' indicates
reconcile is pending for the transaction. 
</P>
<P>For each transaction that appears on your statement, click on the
corresponding transaction in the Reconcile Transactions dialog. As
you proceed, the reconciled balance at the bottom of the dialog will
be updated (the target balance is the ending balance that you
entered). When you have checked all of the transactions on the
statement, the difference displayed at the bottom of the dialog
should be 0.00. 
</P>
<P>When you are finished, press the Done button and the pending
transactions will be marked as reconciled (the 'c' will change to 'C'
and the transactions will not appear the next time you reconcile
transactions). 
</P>
<P>If you need to modify or add a transaction, press the Finish Later
button. This will save the pending reconcile status for the
transactions so you won't need to redo them when you come back to
finish reconciling the transactions.</P>
<P>If you want to cancel the pending changes, press the Cancel
button. The pending reconcile status will be removed from the
transactions.</P>
<P>If you mistakenly reconciled a transaction and pressed the Done
button, you can undo the change by editing the transaction and
selecting the Not Reconciled button.</P>
