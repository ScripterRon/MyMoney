<P>A loan account is used to track a loan such as a car loan or a
home mortgage. When you create the loan account, the first
transaction should be for the loan amount. The loan balance will then
be a negative value which will be reduced each time a payment is
made. Loan payments are typically made using two transactions from a
bank account: the interest payment and the principal payment. The
interest payment specifies a category such as Mortgage Interest. The
principal payment specifies the loan account as the transfer account.
As the loan is repaid, the interest payment amount will decrease and
the principal payment amount will increase. 
</P>
<P>If you use a scheduled transaction to make the payments, MyMoney
will automatically calculate the interest and principal amounts for
each payment when it processes the scheduled transaction.</P>
