<P>An investment account contains securities such as certificates of
deposit, bonds, stocks and treasury notes.  An investment account has
a linked bank account to manage the cash position when an investment
is bought, sold or provides income.  The investment account and the
linked bank account may be managed as a single account by the
financial institution or they may be separate accounts at the same or
different financial institutions.</P>
<P>Each investment transaction has an associated action.  You can
specify an optional category to further classify the transaction. 
The remaining fields are used based on the action selected.</P>

<UL>
	<LI><P>New Transaction &ndash; Create a new investment transaction.</P>
	<LI><P>Edit Transaction &ndash; Modify an existing investment
	transaction.</P>
	<LI><P>Delete Transaction &ndash; Delete an existing investment
	transaction.</P>
</UL>
<H2><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4><I>Investment Actions</I></FONT></FONT></H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Buy &ndash; Buy shares of a security.  Specify the number of
	shares in the S<I>hares</I> field, the price per share in the P<I>rice</I>
	field, the commission in the <I>Commission</I> field and the cost in
	the A<I>mount</I>  field.  The share price times the number of
	shares represents the cost basis for the security.  The amount
	specified will be deducted from the linked bank account.</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P>The cost for a bond does not include accrued interest. 
		Accrued interest is recorded as a separate <I>Expense</I>
		transaction for the security.</P>
		<LI><P>The share price for a bond is often quoted for a 100-share
		lot.  For example, a $10,000 bond would be priced at $100/share for
		100 shares.  
		</P>
		<LI><P>It is convenient to set the share price to $1.00 for
		fixed-income instruments which reinvest interest.  This makes it
		easier to record the reinvestment since the number of shares
		reinvested is the same as the amount of interest received.</P>
	</UL>
	<LI><P>Exchange &ndash; Exchange shares of one security for shares
	in another security.  The A<I>mount</I>  field is the cost basis of
	the new security.  The S<I>hares</I> and N<I>ew Shares</I> fields
	record the number of shares exchanged for the original security and
	the number of shares received for the new security.  The cost basis
	of the original security will be reduced based on the number of
	shares exchanged.</P>
	<LI><P>Expense &ndash; Record an expense for a security in the
	<I>Amount</I> field.  For example, accrued interest paid when
	purchasing a bond or foreign tax paid when receiving a dividend. 
	Use the C<I>ategory</I> field to classify the type of expense.  The
	amount will be deducted from the linked bank account.</P>
	<LI><P>Income &ndash; Record income for a security in the <I>Amount
	</I>field.  For example, interest for a bond or dividend for a
	stock.  Use the C<I>ategory</I> field to classify the type of
	income.  The amount will be added to the linked bank account.</P>
	<LI><P>Reinvest &ndash; Record reinvested income.  The S<I>hares</I>
	field contains the number of shares received and the A<I>mount</I> 
	field contains the amount of income received.  The cost basis of the
	security will be increased by the amount of income received.  The
	amount will be added to the linked bank account.</P>
	<LI><P>RtnCapital &ndash; Record a return of capital for a security
	in the <I>Amount</I> field.  The cost basis for the security will be
	reduced by the amount returned.  The amount will be added to the
	linked bank account.</P>
	<LI><P>Sell &ndash; Sell shares of a security.  Specify the number
	of shares in the S<I>hares</I> field, the price per share in the
	P<I>rice</I> field, the commission in the <I>Commission</I> field
	and the proceeds in the A<I>mount</I>  field.  The amount specified
	will be added to the linked bank account.  In order to calculate the
	cost basis for the sale, the correct accounting method must be
	selected.</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P>FIFO &ndash; First In, First Out.  Shares are sold starting
		with the first shares purchased.  The cost basis is the total cost
		of the shares sold.  This is the normal method when selling stock.</P>
		<LI><P>LIFO &ndash; Last In, First Out.  Shares are sold starting
		with the last shares purchased.  The cost basis is the total cost
		of the shares sold.</P>
		<LI><P>Avg Cost &ndash; Average cost.  The average cost of all
		shares is calculated and this value is then multiplied by the
		number of shares sold to get the cost basis.  This is the normal
		method for a mutual fund.  Once the average cost method is selected
		for a security, it must be used for all subsequent sales of that
		security in order to get the correct cost basis.</P>
	</UL>
	<LI><P>SpinOff &ndash; Shares of a new security are received as a
	result of a spin-off from the original security.  The number of
	shares for the original security remains unchanged by the spin-off. 
	The A<I>mount</I>  field is the cost basis of the new security.  The
	N<I>ew Shares</I> field records the number of shares received for
	the new security.  The cost basis of the original security will be
	reduced by the cost basis of the new security.</P>
	<LI><P>Split &ndash; Record a stock split.  The <I>Shares</I> field
	contains the number of shares received or lost.  For example, in a
	2:1 split of 100 shares, you would receive 100 shares for a total of
	200 shares after the split (the <I>Shares</I> field would be 100). 
	In a 1:2 split of 100 shares, you would lose 50 shares for a total
	of 50 shares after the split (the <I>Shares</I> field would be -50).
	 The cost basis for the security is unchanged by the split.</P>
</UL>
<P>Partial shares received from an exchange, spin-off or stock split
are usually sold immediately by the broker and you receive cash in
lieu of the shares.  In this case, you should record all of the
shares in the exchange, spin-off or stock split transaction.  You
should then create a separate sell transaction to record the cash in
lieu.  This causes the correct cost basis to be calculated for the
remaining shares.</P>
