<P>A bank account represents a checking or savings account where
funds are deposited and withdrawn. Checks can be written against the
account and money can be transferred between accounts (for example,
using direct debit to pay a credit card bill). Transactions in a bank
account can be reconciled with statements received from the bank.</P>
<P>A transaction can be assigned a category (such as Cable, Dividend,
Interest, Utilities, etc). The category is used when generating a
transaction report and when estimating taxes. You do not need to
assign a category to a transaction (the default is no category when
you create a transaction).</P>
<P>Instead of a category, a transaction can be assigned a transfer
account. Transfer accounts appear in the Category/Account field with
the name enclosed in &ldquo;[]&rdquo;. This causes money withdrawn
from the account to be deposited in the transfer account. For
example, when you pay a credit card bill, you would specify the
credit account as the transfer account when you enter the withdrawal
in your bank account. You create just a single transaction which
affects two accounts (you do not create a separate transaction in the
credit account to represent the payment).</P>
<P>The check number and memo are optional fields which are used to
describe the transaction.</P>
<P>You must specify a payment or deposit amount. The amount can be
0.00 for a void transaction (such as a check that was torn up or
never cashed).</P>
<P>You should leave the Not Reconciled button selected when you
create a transaction. Refer to the Reconciling Transactions section
for more information.</P>

<DL>
	<DT>Transaction splits are used when a transaction has multiple
	components. For example, a salary payment may contain federal and
	state withholding with the balance being deposited in a checking
	account. Or a loan payment would consist of interest and principal
	payments. In these cases, you would create a transaction split with
	a split transaction for each component of the transaction.</DL>

<FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4><I>Reconciling Transactions</I></FONT></FONT></H2>
<P>When you reconcile transactions, you indicate which transactions
appear on your bank statement. This is done by pressing the Reconcile
Transactions button and then entering the ending balance from the
statement. A dialog will be displayed listing all of the unreconciled
transactions for the account. Each time you click on a transaction, a
'c' is added or removed for the transaction. The 'c' indicates
reconcile is pending for the transaction. 
</P>
<P>For each transaction that appears on your statement, click on the
corresponding transaction in the Reconcile Transactions dialog. As
you proceed, the reconciled balance at the bottom of the dialog will
be updated (the target balance is the ending balance that you
entered). When you have checked all of the transactions on the
statement, the difference displayed at the bottom of the dialog
should be 0.00. 
</P>
<P>When you are finished, press the Done button and the pending
transactions will be marked as reconciled (the 'c' will change to 'C'
and the transactions will not appear the next time you reconcile
transactions). 
</P>
<P>If you need to modify or add a transaction, press the Finish Later
button. This will save the pending reconcile status for the
transactions so you won't need to redo them when you come back to
finish reconciling the transactions.</P>
<P>If you want to cancel the pending changes, press the Cancel
button. The pending reconcile status will be removed from the
transactions.</P>
<P>If you mistakenly reconciled a transaction and pressed the Done
button, you can undo the change by editing the transaction and
selecting the Not Reconciled button.</P>
