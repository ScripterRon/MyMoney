<P>The Archive function will remove transactions up to and including
the archive date. These transactions will be written to a new
database named &ldquo;MyMoney Archive yyyy&rdquo; where yyyy is the
year from the archive date. A new transaction for each account will
be created if necessary to update the account balance after removing
the transactions.</P>
<P>Investment transactions other than Income and Expense will not be
removed until the associated security has been sold. These
transactions must be kept in order to display the security portfolio
and to determine the cost basis for the security.</P>
<P>The archive database can be opened using File &rarr; Open in order
to view these transactions at a later time. You can rename the
archive database after it has been created if you want to use a
different name (the file extension must remain .database if you want
to be able to open it in MyMoney).</P>
<P>Note that the Net Worth graph will be incorrect for the period
before the archive date. This occurs because all of the transactions
before the archive date have been replaced with a single transaction
reflecting the net account balance as of the archive date.</P>
